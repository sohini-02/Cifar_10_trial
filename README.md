For one of my undergraduate internships, I was asked to build a simple CNN that would be trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset and be able to classify an unknown image into one of the predefined 10 categories available in CIFAR-10. I implemented the same model 4 times, by changing a metric every time, and my final report analyzed the differences in accuracy between the four resultant models.
